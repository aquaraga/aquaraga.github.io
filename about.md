My name is Kumar Iyer. I am passionate about software technology, music and literature.
I work as a Lead Consultant developer for an amazing company, [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com).

I'm a programming language enthusiast and love to compare, contrast and critique languages. Having coded in atleast nine programming languages for accomplishing non-trivial tasks, Haskell happens to be my favourite language with Clojure coming in a close second, maybe because of my love for pure functional languages for their expressiveness and how delicately they tread the line between simplicity and sophistication. My dream is to work on a data science project (with statistical modelling) at a professional level, and hope it comes true in the near future!
